# <img style="height: 2rem; vertical-align:middle" src="./docs/img/favicon.svg"> VTuber Hub
A website which makes use of [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to gather information about VTuber channels, which is then copied into an array and generated into HTML lists using Javascript.

## Current Listing

Since hololive and holostars channels have featured channels showcasing their members, obtaining the necessary information was simple and therefore they are the only currently listed VTuber groups.
